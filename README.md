# Elevator-Condition-Monitoring

About the project:
The current challenge in lift systems lies in the absence of proactive monitoring mechanisms, leading to unexpected failures, safety risks, and financial consequences. The lack of real-time insights into elevator health, magnified by factors such as wear and tear, environmental conditions, and component failures, underscores the critical need for an advanced condition monitoring system. Addressing this gap is essential to ensure the reliable operation of elevators, enhance safety, and optimize maintenance operations, ultimately mitigating inconvenience and minimizing economic impact.

Our project, by utilizing various sensors delves into condition and prevention monitoring for lift systems, going into detail about the various sensors which can be embedded and the monitoring methods that can be applied to a particular system.
